Blappsta: This plugin is the first step to a free native App for iOS (iPhone) and Android.

= Turn your blog into a free native App and even earn money =

Build you app in only a few minutes. Instantly test it using our [test app in the App store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nebelhorn/id707029895?mt=8). If you like it, you can instantly setup an account and we will take care of pushing the app into the stores. Advertisement in the app lets you even create revenue.

**Increase the number of readers of your blog of news app with Push Notification**
Notify your readers with our free push notification service build into the plugin. This service will increase your number of readers largely. You can decide when and what you want to push.
