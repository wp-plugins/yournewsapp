== Description ==

yourBlogApp / yourNewsApp: This plugin is the first step to a free native App for iOS (iPhone) and Android.

= Turn your blog into a free native App and even earn money =

Build you app in only a few minutes. Instantly test it using our [test app in the App store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nebelhorn/id707029895?mt=8). If you like it, you can instantly setup an account and we will take care of pushing the app into the stores. Advertisement in the app lets you even create revenue.
