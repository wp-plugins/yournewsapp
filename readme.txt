Make your blog a native app!

== Description ==

The Blappsta plugin is the first step to a free native App for iOS (iPhone) and Android.

= Turn your blog into a free native app =
Don’t fall for the typical HTML web apps with poor usability. And don't spend money for a native app in iOS (iPhone) and Android.
Build your individual app using your favorite colors and your own logo in only a few minutes. Instantly test it using our Blappsta Preview app from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blappsta-preview/id912390326?mt=8) or [Google Play&trade; Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blappsta.blappstaappcheck). If you like it, go to [www.blappsta.com](https://www.blappsta.com/sign-up) and we will take care of pushing the app into the stores. 
Check out our [website](https://www.blappsta.com) for more information about Blappsta.

= Increase the number of readers of your blog with Push Notification =
Notify your readers with our free push notification service build into the plugin. This service will increase your number of readers largely. You can decide when and what you want to push. 

= Features of the app =
- send push notifications
- share to Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and email
- show the feed of your Facebook page (optional)
- allows commenting and reading comments
- continual improvement guaranteed
- free of charge for non-commercial use

= Features of the plugin =
- fully integrated in WordPress
- send push notifications directly from a post or page
- edit teaser content in your app
- add category images for your app
- individualize your app menu
- set your home screen look

= Blappsta BUSINESS features =
Our Blappsta BUSINESS version is the solution for commercial use (e.g. corporate blogs). Blappsta BUSINESS enables many more features, like integration of events and setup of iBeacon.

= There is more to come! =
These features are currently under development and will soon be part of Blappsta:
- support for videos
- image galleries
- a growing number of available themes
- a list of the most popular articles instead of the categories or the latest articles up front
- iPad/Android Tablet version
- Windows Phone version



= How it works =
1. Install and activate the plugin.
2. To get a preview on what the app would look like, download and install our Blappsta Preview App from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blappsta-preview/id912390326?mt=8) or [Google Play  Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.blappsta.blappstaappcheck).
3. Start the Blappsta Preview App and enter your blog’s URL or simply scan the QR-code you find in the Blappsta Plugin settings with our integrated scanner.
4. Of course all of the settings can be changed at any time. A simple „pull to refresh“ suffices in order to take over the settings in the app.
5. Do you like what you see? Then go to [www.blappsta.com](https://www.blappsta.com/sign-up) and we will take care of pushing the app into the stores.
6. If you have any questions contact us: support@blappsta.com


== Installation ==

1. Install Blappsta either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.
2. Once activated go to Settings > Blappsta Plugin.
3. Update your settings for your app.
