Your Blog and News App Builder for iPhone and Android

== Description ==

Blappsta: This plugin is the first step to a free native App for iOS (iPhone) and Android.

= Turn your blog into a free native App and even earn money =
Don’t fall for the typical HTML web apps with poor usability. And don't spend money for a native app in iOS (iPhone) and Android. Blappsta is the first native App which is not only free for you but also enables you to earn money. 
Build your app in only a few minutes. Instantly test it using our test app from the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blappsta-your-blog.-your-app./id865289027?mt=8) or [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nebelhorn.blappsta&hl=de). If you like it, you can instantly setup an account and we will take care of pushing the app into the stores. Advertisement in the app lets you even create revenue.
Check out our [website](http://www.blappsta.com) for more information about Blappsta.

**Increase the number of readers of your blog with Push Notification**
Notify your readers with our free push notification service build into the plugin. This service will increase your number of readers largely. You can decide when and what you want to push. 

**Features of the app**
Some of the app features:
- for iOS and Android devices
- sharing via Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and email
- send push notifications
- show the feed of your Facebook page (optional)
- your logo, your icons, your colors
- your app can enable commenting and reading comments
- continual improvement guaranteed

**Features of the plugin**
- fully integrated in WordPress
- send push-notifications directly from a post
- edit teaser content
- add category images
- individualize app menu
- set homepresets for the app start screen

**Blappsta Business features**
Our Business version version of the native app enables many more features like integration of events, setup of iBeacon, couponing and content triggering

**Design your app**
There are a number of settings where you can change the looks of the app. Give it a try and test your design in the [emulator](http://www.blappsta.com/emulator/) or our [Blappsta Test App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blappsta-your-blog.-your-app./id865289027?mt=8).

**No build time required**
Not like other app builders we do not require any build time. You can instantly test the app in our [test app](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/nebelhorn/id707029895?mt=8) and if you like it, setup an account on [www.blappsta.com](http://www.blappsta.com) and we upload the app for you after approval.

**There is more to come!**
These features are currently under development and will soon be part of Blappsta:
- support for videos
